## 2. Context

The learning game is being developed as a submission for the 15th Pirate Software Game Jam. The themes of the game jam are "Shadows" and "Alchemy", both of which needs to be featured in the game. The game jam takes place from the 17th of July until the 31st of July and therefore has a duration of two weeks.

### 2.1 Purpose

- The developers should have fun.
- The developers should improve their game development skills.
- The developers should end up with an artifact which demonstrates their development skills.
- Educational institutions should have access to another tool for teaching introductory optics.

### 2.2 Target Audience and Setting

The target audience for the game is high school students, playing on relatively weak laptops, at home or in the classroom. The game is only meant to give an intuition about optics before the topic is tackled more thoroughly.

The scope of the target setting is reduced by (1) assuming that laptops do not have touch input, (2) that the laptops are connected to the internet, (3) that they have browsers that can open websites, and (4) that the players understand English.

### 2.3 Team Structure and Responsibilities

The development team consist of: Leo, responsible for game design, pedagogy, programming, music, and audio; and RP, responsible for visuals.

## 3. Design

### 3.1 Fantasy

Playing as an alchemist that is actually just doing chemistry.

Multiple names used for the same gases or substances as well as the history of the name to give clues about the game mechanics.

- Hydrogen
  - Gas that can generate water when combusted with oxygen.
    - Hydro-gen (en.) ("gen" has the same origin as "generating")
    - Water substance (nb: "vannstoff")
- Oxygen
  - Gas that sustains flames.
    - Flame gas / flame air (sv: "eldluft")
  - Gas that is part of reactions that create acid.
    - Acid substance (nb: "surstoff")
    - Oxy-gen (en.) (oxy means "acid", comes from Greek meaning "sharp") ("gen" has the same origin as "generating")
  - Gas that is vital to life.
    - Vital gas / vital air (nb: "vitalluft")
- Oxyhydrogen
  - Gas that explodes when ignited.
    - Boom gas (nb: "knallgass")
  - Gas that is a mixture of oxygen and hydrogen.
    - Oxyhydrogen
- Nitrogen
  - Gas that causes asphyxiation.
    - Choke gas / choke substance (nb: "kvelstoff")

### 3.3 Art Style and Visuals

- Cutout
- Stop motion

### 3.4 Audio and Music

## 4. Development

### 4.1 Tools

The game will be developed in Unity. Unity offers a solid mix of 2D and 3D rendering features that fit well to the planned 2.5D art style. It is also the engine that the programmer is most used to.
