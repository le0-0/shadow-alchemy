## Context

The learning game is being developed as a submission for the 15th Pirate Software Game Jam. The themes of the game jam are "Shadows" and "Alchemy", both of which needs to be featured in the game. The game jam takes place from the 17th of July until the 31st of July and therefore has a duration of two weeks.

### Purpose

- The developers should have fun.
- The developers should improve their game development skills.
- The developers should end up with an artifact which demonstrates their development skills.
- Educational institutions should have access to another tool for teaching introductory optics.

### Target Audience and Setting

The target audience for the game is high school students, playing on relatively weak laptops, at home or in the classroom. The game is only meant to give an intuition about optics before the topic is tackled more thoroughly.

The scope of the target setting is reduced by (1) assuming that laptops do not have touch input, (2) that the laptops are connected to the internet, (3) that they have browsers that can open websites, and (4) that the players understand English.

### Team Structure and Responsibilities

The development team consist of: Leo, responsible for game design, pedagogy, programming, music, and audio; and RP, responsible for visuals.

## 1. Design

### Fantasy

The fantasy in Shadow Crafter can be split into two parts, the realistic part and the fantastical part. The realistic part of the fantasy consists of light, colors, light sources, obstructions, slits, lenses, prisms, mirrors, etc. These objects in the fantasy behave like the same objects in the real world. The fantastical part of the fantasy includes the color sensitive plants and fungus, and the world where these plants and fungus is required.

The setting of the game is based on the fantasy trope of the European middle ages, like Frieren. In the world of the game, specific plants and fungus that requires specific light conditions are grown by herbalists and alchemists to be used for brewing potions, medicine, and cooking.

Fantasy is about making the impossible possible. Although you can technically achieve the realistic part of the fantasy in the real world, by obtaining the same objects and assembling the level, this is still considered fantasy because doing so in the real world would be too time consuming and expensive.

Framed in terms from the literature on fantasy in games, the realistic fantasy is an intrinsic fantasy, while the fantastical fantasy is extrinsic. For the former, this is because understanding the realistic fantasy, or in other words the optics of the real world, is an integral part of the skill needed to progress in the game. When fantasy is used in games, it is always the case that the succeeding in the game leads to success in the fantasy. Being skilled at playing the game leads to success as a herbalist in the world of Shadow Crafter; however, understanding the fantastical elements of the fantasy does not contribute much to solving the challenge of the game, which is why the fantastical fantasy is extrinsic. It is simply overlaid the actual game mechanics and challenge of the game.

Intrinsic fantasies are preferred. Intrinsic fantasies typically lead to better learning outcomes because the fantasy elements are directly tied to the skills or knowledge being taught. This integration helps players understand and retain information more effectively. When the fantasy is intrinsically linked to the core mechanics or learning objectives, players are more likely to be genuinely engaged with the content. The fantasy isn't just a superficial layer but an integral part of the experience. Intrinsic fantasies can create a more cohesive and immersive experience, as the game world and its mechanics are more tightly integrated. When the fantasy aligns closely with the skills being learned, it reduces cognitive load. Players don't have to mentally separate the fantasy elements from the core learning or gameplay. These fantasies can foster intrinsic motivation, where players are driven by the inherent satisfaction of the activity itself rather than external rewards.
